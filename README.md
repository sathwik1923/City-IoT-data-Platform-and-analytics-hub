# Smart City IoT Data Platform and Analytics Hub

A robust system for real-time data collection, processing, and visualization from urban sensors using AWS services.

## Project Overview

The Smart City IoT Data Platform and Analytics Hub is designed to process and analyze real-time data from various IoT sensors deployed in a smart city environment. The project aims to provide valuable insights into urban infrastructure like traffic flow, air quality, energy usage, and waste management. The platform utilizes AWS cloud services, including AWS IoT Core, Lambda, RDS, and Kinesis, for a scalable, secure, and efficient solution. Data collected from sensors is processed, stored, and visualized in real-time for easy access and decision-making.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a real-time data collection and processing platform for IoT sensors deployed in a smart city.
- To provide actionable insights through advanced analytics and data visualization.
- To create a robust infrastructure for handling high-volume sensor data streams.
- To optimize city operations such as traffic flow, energy consumption, and waste management.
- To leverage AWS services for secure and scalable cloud infrastructure management.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and tools to ensure optimal functionality and scalability:
- **AWS IoT Core**: Manages the connectivity and communication between IoT devices and the cloud.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes code for real-time data processing and analytics.
- **AWS Kinesis**: Handles real-time streaming of IoT sensor data.
- **AWS RDS with PostgreSQL**: Stores and manages processed data for later analysis.
- **Tableau & Power BI**: Provides real-time data visualization and dashboarding for decision-makers.
- **Python**: Used for simulating sensor data and processing data before storage.
- **PHP**: Powers the API to expose real-time data to external services and applications.

## System Architecture

The system is designed using a cloud-native architecture based on AWS services. Below is a brief overview of the key components:
- **IoT Sensors**: Devices deployed throughout the city to collect data such as traffic volume, air quality, energy usage, and waste levels.
- **AWS IoT Core**: Serves as the communication layer between IoT sensors and cloud services.
- **AWS Kinesis**: Manages real-time streaming of data from IoT sensors to AWS Lambda functions for processing.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes custom code for data processing, including traffic optimization and pollution detection algorithms.
- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Stores the processed data in a structured, scalable database for analysis and reporting.
- **Data Visualizations**: Tableau and Power BI provide graphical insights into the data, displaying trends and analytics for decision-making.

## Data Collection and Simulation

In this project, Python scripts are used to simulate sensor data. These simulated data include information on:
- **Traffic Flow**: Vehicle count, speed, and congestion data.
- **Air Quality**: Pollutant concentration levels (e.g., CO2, NO2) and AQI (Air Quality Index).
- **Energy Consumption**: Household and industrial energy usage metrics.
- **Waste Management**: Waste collection data, including waste type and quantity.

The Python scripts continuously generate and push data into AWS IoT Core, where it is streamed to AWS Kinesis for real-time processing. The data is then processed by AWS Lambda functions and stored in PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.

## Database Design and Schema

To manage the data efficiently, a relational database design is implemented in PostgreSQL. The schema includes tables for various types of data, ensuring normalization and easy querying:
- **Traffic Flow**: Includes columns like `vehicle_id, timestamp, speed, congestion_level, lane`.
- **Air Quality**: Includes columns like `sensor_id, timestamp, CO2_level, NO2_level, AQI`.
- **Energy Consumption**: Includes columns like `device_id, timestamp, energy_used`.
- **Waste Management**: Includes columns like `bin_id, timestamp, waste_type, waste_quantity`.

Each table is optimized for performance, and appropriate indexing ensures efficient querying even with large datasets.

## API Development

The system includes a custom-built API developed using PHP, which provides access to the data stored in AWS RDS. The API allows for the retrieval of real-time data on traffic, air quality, energy usage, and waste management in JSON format. This API serves as a crucial component for integration with external applications, such as mobile apps or third-party data analysis tools.

### Key features of the API:
- Secure access to data using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Data retrieval endpoints for each type of sensor data (traffic, air quality, etc.).
- Real-time access to the latest data generated by IoT sensors.
- Support for filtering and querying data by time range, sensor type, and location.

## Data Visualization

Real-time and historical data visualizations are created using Tableau and Power BI. Dashboards and interactive reports allow city officials and decision-makers to track key metrics and identify trends. Some of the visualization features include:
- **Traffic Flow Dashboard**: Visualizes real-time traffic data, vehicle counts, and congestion levels in different city areas.
- **Air Quality Dashboard**: Displays current air quality levels and trends over time, helping to monitor pollution levels.
- **Energy Consumption Dashboard**: Provides insights into energy usage across different city sectors, helping optimize consumption patterns.
- **Waste Management Dashboard**: Tracks waste collection efficiency and monitors recycling efforts in different neighborhoods.

These visualizations help improve city management and decision-making, allowing for proactive actions to improve urban living conditions.

## Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

To optimize city operations, advanced algorithms and data structures are employed:
- **Graph Data Structures**: Used to represent the city's infrastructure for efficient analysis of traffic flow and optimization algorithms.
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Used to calculate the most optimal traffic routes in real-time, improving traffic management during peak hours.
- **SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors)**: A forecasting model used to predict future air quality levels based on historical data.

These algorithms ensure the system can offer real-time insights and make data-driven decisions that benefit the city's infrastructure and citizens.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of integrating IoT sensors with cloud computing services to create a scalable and efficient smart city platform. By leveraging AWS services and modern data processing techniques, the Smart City IoT Data Platform offers valuable insights into urban infrastructure management, promoting better decision-making and optimizing city operations for a sustainable future.
